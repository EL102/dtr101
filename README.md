This repository contains unit-e project information which does not belong
directly in the code repository or which spans multiple repositories. It's
kind of the unit-e meta repository.

* [ADRs](adrs) - Records of architectural decisions on code or process. This
  represents a lightweight process to keep track of decisions and their
  motivations. Discussions and decisions on the Unit-e protocol are covered by
  the Unit-e Improvement Proposals (UIP) process and live in the [dtr-org/uips
  repository](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips).
* [Project guidelines](project) - Project-wide guidelines and conventions
* [Code guides](code-guides) - Informal documentation helping to understand the
  code. You could think of this a bit like a Wiki but in git.
